# Experience

## Research Assistant, Univeristy of Maryland, 2020-Present

I am conducting full-time research work studying the nature of exoplanet
atmospheres using
established models such as
[`Atmos`](https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/atmos),
[`HELIOS`](https://github.com/exoclime/HELIOS), and
[`Exo\_Transmit`](https://github.com/teald/Exo_Transmit).
I am also leading the development of a novel Python-based photochemistry model,
"`pyccard`", leveraging modular design concepts to enable advanced and seamless
model coupling abilities. `pyccard` features intelligent function parsing,
memory sharing, a C API and C backend solver, and adaptive chemical network
selection. At the time of its release in 2023, it will also leverage machine
learning---either [`PyTorch`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) or
[`TensorFlow`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)---to generate initial
conditions and reaction networks.

+ Actively developing code in Python, C, and Fortran
+ Collaborating in groups ranging from 5 to 50 collaborators across the globe.
+ My work is funded by grants through the Hubble Space Telescope and the National Science Foundation. I am a co-investigator on several successful proposals, contributing text and figures.
+ I have contributed to [a number of refereed publications](https://tinyurl.com/adsentries).

## Teaching Assistant, University of Maryland, 2018-2020

Alongside taking advanced graduate-level courses in astronomy, astrophysics,
and computational physics courses, I taught undergraduate-level courses in
mathematics and astronomy. I received the [2019 Philip E. Angerhofer
Outstanding Teaching Assistant
Award](https://www.astro.umd.edu/resources/internal/awards/dept/angerhofer.html)
for my work leading discussion sections and laboratory units. I also
participated in various kinds of outreach events, served on the astronomy
department's [Equity, Diversity, and
Inclusion](https://www.astro.umd.edu/EDI/EDICommittee.html) committee,
co-founded [Astronomy Community Engagement](https://ace.astro.umd.edu/).

I also conducted research related to my Master's theis, which resulted in a
[2022 publication in the Astrophysical
Journal](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...90T/abstract). This
research included active development of the
[`Atmos`](https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/atmos) photochemistry
and climate model, as well as
[`Exo_Transmit`](https://github.com/teald/Exo_Transmit).

+ Taught college-level courses in astronomy and mathematics.
+ Service work in astronomy outreach to a variety of demographics.
+ Actively maintained and used advanced Fortran, C, and Python models.
+ Took advanced courses in astronomy and astrophysics. 

## Research Contractor, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, 2017-2018

While at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), my work focused on a
variety of research questions as well as developing a web-based software
product to better enable the public to access and use planetary physics models.

I used [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
[Django](https://github.com/django/django) to test the feasibility of shipping
Fortran binary to users and providing a web-based application to demonstrate
the power of the Fortran product. I also worked on designing standards and
improving user-experience on the [Exoplanet Modelling and Analysis Center
(EMAC)](https://emac.gsfc.nasa.gov/) website which hosts a catalog of planetary
science models and tools.

+ Developed web-based frameworks for shipping Fortran software using Docker.
+ Worked on a web application to showcase the features of [`Atmos`](https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/atmos) using Django.
+ Conducted research on several important questions in astrophysics:
    + Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) filter selection model to automatically remove background noise while optimizing signal for direct-imaging and characterization of exoplanets.
    + Response of Earth-like exoplanet atmospheres to varying irradiation from the host star.
    + Contributed to the [LUVIOR Flagship Observatory Final Report](https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/luvoir/reports/) as part of the
      exoplanets community working group.

## Junior Specialist, University of California, Santa Cruz, 2016-2017

I conducted research on how haze impacts our ability to model and characterize the composition of exoplanet atmospheres using existing statistical techniques, as well as the generation and analysis of a massive Brown Dwarf atmospheres data product.

+ Studied the impacts of hydrocarbon hazes on exoplanet characterization and observation.
+ Collaborated on the generation and analysis of a large data product providing pre-calculated Brown Dwarf models across a wide parameter space.
