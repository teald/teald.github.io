You've reached the personal webpage of Dillon Teal ("Teal"), an astronomer and
software developer with over a decade of experience solving problems ranging
from atomic to galactic scales and beyond.

On this site you can find my 
[resume](/documents/professional/resume.pdf) and 
[curriculum vitae](/documents/professional/cv.pdf).

Of course, you can always just get an idea of who I am using my [about me](/about) page
before you decide to keep going. :)
