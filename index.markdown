You've reached the personal webpage of Dillon Teal ("Teal"), an astronomer and
model developer excited to start applying over a decade of experience to novel
problems in the real world.

On this site you can find my 
[abridged resume](/documents/professional/resume.pdf) and 
[curriculum vitae](/documents/professional/cv.pdf).

Of course, you can always just get a whiff using my [about me](/about) page
before you decide to keep going. :)
