Welcome to the personal website of Dillon Teal ("Teal"). They use "They/Them/Their" pronouns.

Teal is a PhD candidate at the University of Maryland, College Park. Their research focuses on the chemistry and physics of planetary atmospheres ranging from terrestrial to gas giant planets.

They have extensive experience as an astrophysicist, having earned their B.S. in Physics (Astrophysics) at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2015, and their M.S. in Astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park in 2020. They are or have been involved in several collaborations, including the [Sellers Exoplanet Environments Collaboration (SEEC)](https://seec.gsfc.nasa.gov/) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the [Virtual Planetary Laboratory](https://depts.washington.edu/naivpl/content/welcome-virtual-planetary-laboratory), the [Other Worlds Laboratory](https://owl.ucsc.edu/), and many project-specific collaborations spanning the globe.

They also have experience in software development, primarily in the context of scientific software. They worked on back-end functionality of NASA's [Exoplanet Modelling and Analysis Center](https://emac.gsfc.nasa.gov/) using Docker. They are an expert Python programmer with over a decade of experience, and wield considerable experience in Fortran, C, and C++.

When not working or coding, Teal enjoys several fiber arts---particularly crochet and spinning yarn. They also invest time in tabletop RPGs and video games (perhaps less than is ideal).
